## Week 1 â€“ Design Patterns and Principles, DSA

- Practiced SOLID principles and 11 key design patterns like Singleton and Factory.  
- Solved real-world Java exercises for each pattern to learn clean code structure.  
- Learned DSA basics like arrays, linked lists, sorting and searching algorithms.  
- Did hands-on coding for bubble sort, binary search, etc.  
- This week helped me improve both design thinking and logic building skills.

## Week 2 â€“ PL/SQL, TDD & Logging Frameworks

- Learned PL/SQL concepts like block structure, variables, control structures, exceptions, and cursors.  
- Practiced writing procedures, functions, packages, and triggers with hands-on examples for database logic.  
- Understood Test-Driven Development (TDD) and implemented test cases using JUnit.  
- Used Mockito for mocking Spring components and verifying interactions.  
- Explored automation tools like Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber.  
- Implemented SLF4J for structured logging and learned log levels and appenders.

## Week 3 â€“ Spring Core, AOP & Spring Boot

- Built Spring projects using Maven and implemented DI using XML, annotations, and Java config.  
- Applied Spring AOP for cross-cutting concerns like logging using AspectJ.  
- Developed a full-stack Spring Boot CRUD application with REST endpoints and tested with Postman.  
- Used Spring Data JPA to implement service layers with repository interfaces for entity operations.  
- Performed insert, update, delete, and partial search features using `CommandLineRunner`.

## Week 4 â€“ Spring REST, Spring Boot 3 & JWT Authentication

- Built RESTful services using Spring Boot 3 and explored REST fundamentals like HTTP methods, path/query parameters, and JSON handling.  
- Created DTOs to separate data layers and added input validation using annotations.  
- Performed full CRUD operations and applied content negotiation for JSON/XML responses.  
- Implemented JWT-based token authentication using `jjwt` and secured endpoints with Spring Security.  
- Monitored REST APIs using Spring Boot Actuator and learned to expose custom metrics.  
- Practiced unit and integration testing with JUnit, Mockito, and documented APIs using Swagger.

## Week 5 â€“ Microservices, Spring Cloud & API Gateway

- Understood the fundamentals of microservices and how they differ from monolithic architecture.
- Explored core principles like single responsibility, decentralized data management, and continuous delivery.
- Identified challenges in microservices such as inter-service communication, monitoring, and data consistency.
- Implemented microservices components like Service Registry (Eureka), API Gateway, and Load Balancing.
- Secured communication using OAuth2, JWT, and centralized authentication mechanisms in Spring Security.
- Used Spring Cloud tools like Feign Client, Config Server, and Circuit Breaker patterns for resilience.
- Learned to monitor microservices using Spring Boot Actuator, Prometheus, and Grafana dashboards.

## Week 6 â€“ React JS & Component-Based Development

- Built multiple hands-on apps using React with both functional and class-based components.
- Practiced creating reusable components, managing props, and styling elements with inline CSS.
- Implemented stateful logic in class components and updated UI dynamically using event handlers.
- Focused on matching UI with real-world mockups and learned structured JSX layout practices.

--- 

## Week 7 â€“ Advanced React Concepts and Application Building

- Used ES6 features like map and filter to dynamically render lists and manipulate data.
- Practiced conditional rendering to display different components based on application state.
- Handled user interactions with event handlers and managed state using both hooks and classes.
- Implemented the Context API for sharing global data, like themes, between components.
- Built controlled forms with real-time validation to provide instant user feedback.
- Fetched data from a REST API using lifecycle methods to populate components dynamically.

## Week 8 â€“ Git Fundamentals & GitLab Integration

- Configured a local Git environment with user details and VS Code as the default editor.
- Practiced the core Git workflow of initializing repos, staging files, and committing changes.
- Used a .gitignore file to exclude logs and temporary files from version control.
- Managed development workflows by creating, switching, and pushing branches to GitLab.
- Merged feature branches into master and viewed the project history using decorated logs.
- Resolved a merge conflict by manually editing the conflicted file and committing the fix.
- Synchronized the local repository with GitLab by pushing all local commits and branches.
