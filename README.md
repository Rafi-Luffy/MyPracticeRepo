# Week 1 â€“ Design Patterns and Principles , DSA

Practiced SOLID principles and 11 key design patterns like Singleton and Factory.  
Solved real-world Java exercises for each pattern to learn clean code structure.  
Learned DSA basics like arrays, linked lists, sorting and searching algorithms.  
Did hands-on coding for bubble sort, binary search, etc.  
This Week helped me improve both design thinking and logic building skills.
